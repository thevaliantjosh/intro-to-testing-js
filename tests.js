// Unit tests for the helloWorld function

// Step 1: Let's write the smallest test possible. Open up tests.js. Add a describe, an it, and an expect to assert that sayHello is a defined function. Use your tests for helloWorld as a guide.
// Step 2: Run all the tests. At this point, we're expecting and hoping for a single, red failing test that we just now authored.
// Step 3: Now, let's go to code.js and create an empty function definition for sayHello.
// Step 4: Run all the tests. We're expecting all tests, including the new test for sayHello to be green.
// Step 5: Given that this is our first (tiny) test and our first implementation, there is not yet the opportunity to refactor.
//     Step 6: The last TDD step is to "repeat" the process of adding another test. What we're going to do is add our work to git and then move to Exercise #2, which is to add the second test.

// Exercise #2: New tests for sayHello will each have their own expect and it inside the describe previously created. Each function you are writing and testing should typically have its own describe
// Step 1: The smallest possible test, now that the function exists, is to ensure that calling the function gives us a string. Inside of tests.js, add an assertion to sayHello that it "should return a string when called.". The test should look similar to expect(typeof sayHello()).toBe("string")
// Step 2: Run all tests to make sure that the new test starts red.
//     Step 3: Have your sayHello function return a string. The simplest code and smallest change possible is to return an empty string return "".
//     Step 4: Now, run all the tests to ensure that the previously red test is now turned green by our impelementation.
//     Step 5: There's nothing to refactor.
// Step 6: Repeat (Repeat the process by moving to build the next, small test)
// Always: Add, commit, and push your work to GitHub.
